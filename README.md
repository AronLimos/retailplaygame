## Installation & Setup

**Pre-requisites:** MySQL Database & Workbench

### 1. Prepare MySQL Database Schema

Prepare the MySQL database by running the application first and then overriding the database schema.

- #### 1.1 Navigate the project directory and update the `user`, `password` and `port` in application.properties:

- #### 1.2 Run the app to initialize the database in MySQL.

- #### 1.3 In MySQL Workbench, start a connection with that user and run the `schema.sql` from sqlscripts folder in the project directory.

- #### 1.4 In MySQL Workbench, run the `seed_data_schema.sql` from sqlscripts folder in the project directory.

- #### 1.5 The MySQL database schema is now prepared. 




### 2. Prepare User Roles

#### 2.1 Customer
- Create a new user through the register page in the app, and login through it.

#### 2.2 Owner
- Create a new user through the register page in the app (assume userID = 15).
- In MySQL workbench, insert `ROLE_OWNER` in the authorities table using the same userID.
```
authorityID | userID | authority
12          | 15     | ROLE_CUSTOMER
13          | 15     | ROLE_OWNER     <-- INSERT THIS ROW
```
- Login through the app using the registered credentials.

#### 2.3 Admin
